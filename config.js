        "Through thoughtful preparation and a focused strategy, we helped our client achieve a strong result. The home sold for $1,000,000, which was $71,000 above the $929,000 asking price. It sold in just 8 days, well ahead of the local average. The campaign generated 22 qualified showings, and we secured the right buyer through clear positioning and professional marketing. During negotiations, we were able to increase the buyer’s initial offer by $40,000, even without competing bids. The sale closed smoothly, without any renegotiations or unexpected issues.\n\nThis outcome was the result of preparation, experience, and an approach tailored to the home and the market."
